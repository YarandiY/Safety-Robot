# Safety Robot
This is a gas leak detection with automatic fan control. The goal is designing a safety robot with FreeRTOS that is a kind of Real-time Operating Systems. 

## Implementation
The robot is programmed in C++ (used PlatformIO) and simulated with Proteus. I used Arduino Uno as it's microcontroller, MQ2 Sensor for detecting gases and Ultrasonic Sensor for measuring the distance of a target object and two DC Motors for wheels and rotate the fan.
